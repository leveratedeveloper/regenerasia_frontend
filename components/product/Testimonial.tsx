            Wow!! Where do I start! I was introduced to The Human Regeneratorâ„¢ by the amazing Helen! I am suffering from severe endometriosis and after having finished my first course my symptoms are so much better and I really wish I could have known about this sooner.

            My energy has come back and I no longer need to take painkillers and this is only the beginning; I'm excited to see how my body continues to heal. Thank you Helen and Richie for all your knowledge and support on my journey. I am very grateful!!
